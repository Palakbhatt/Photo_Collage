Challenge - Instagram Style Photo Collage

PROBLEM STATEMENT : Use OpenCV and Numpy to build a photo collage

1. You have to build a photo collage using 5 images of pokemon as given in the dataset. The sample collage image and images to use in the collage are given.

2. You need to resize each pokemon 200X200 before using it. The final image should have size 430 X 430 px
(10 border + 200 pokemon + 10 border + 200 pokemon + 10 border = 430 px) along row and column.

3. After that you need to convert the final image into a single.csv file of the shape (rows x cols, 3).The CSV file should have a header "r,g,b" as column names.
